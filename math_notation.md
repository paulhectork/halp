# Math notation

---

## Logic

- $$\exists$$: exists
- $$\exists!$$: uniqueness (exists one and only one)
- $$\nexists$$: does not exist
- $$\forall$$: for all
- $$\neg$$: logical negation
- $$\lor$$: logical or
- $$\land$$: logical and
- $$\top$$: true or always true
- $$\bot$$: false or always false

---

## Sets

**Some sets**
- $$\mathbb{R}$$: real numbers
- $$\mathbb{N}$$: natural numbers (positive integers)
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$: integers
- $$\mathbb{Q}$$: rational numbers (fraction of 2 integers)

**Relations between sets**

- $$\in$$: belongs to
- $$\cap$$: intersection
- $$\cup$$: union
- $$\subset$$: inclusion: $$x \subset y$$ means that $$x$$ includes $$y$$
- $$\supset$$: superset: $$x \supset y$$ means that $$x$$ is included by $$y$$
- $$\ni$$: contains: $$x \ni y$$ means that $$x$$ contains $$y$$
- $$\setminus$$ or $$-$$: set difference. $$Z = X \setminus Y$$ means that $$Z$$ is formed by the elements of $$X$$that are not in $$Y$$
- $$\times$$: cartesian product
- $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$:  $$n$$ being a positive integer, describes a space of vectors of dimension $$n$$ made of real numbers
    - $$x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$$ => $$x = (1,2)$$
    - $$x \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$$ => $$x = (1,2,3)$$


**Other**
- $$\emptyset$$ or $$\{ \}$$: empty set
- $$\#X$$ or $$|X|$$: number of elements of set $$X$$

---

## Linear algebra

- $$\Sigma$$: sum 
- $$\Pi$$: product
- $$\otimes$$: tensor product 
- $$\oplus$$: direct sum
- $$M^{T}$$: transposition
- $$\|X\|$$: norm of a vector space. The "norm" is equivalent to the notion of "length"
    - $$\|y - x\|$$ is the distance between 2 vectors $$y$$ and $$x$$.

---

## Vectors

- $$X \times Y$$, with $$X$$ and $$Y$$ vector spaces, is the **cartesian product** of $$X$$ with $$Y$$

---

## Probabilities

- $$\mathbb{E}$$: expected value / espérance mathématique 
    - $$\mathbb{E}(X)$$ is the probability to obtain $$X$$.
- $$\sim$$: tiré de / randomly extracted from a distribution.
    - given: 
        - $$X$$ and $$Y$$ 2 sets
        - $$Z=(X,Y)$$ the distribution of $$(X,Y)$$ along a probability function $$P$$ ($$Z$$ is all the possible $$(x,y)$$ pairs distributed along $$P$$)
    - $$(x,y) \sim Z$$ means "a tuple $$(x,y)$$ randomly extracted from a distribution $$Z$$"
